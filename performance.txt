For 100 steps:

		Naive			Grid
100		   500ms		   400ms
1000		38,200ms		 3,800ms
10000		>30s for single step	36,600ms

The values are rounded averages of four repetitions.
The setup for the test can be seen as a comment in the initialize() method. In the nested loop k was iterated 1, 10 and 100 times to generate the given number of spheres.
m_fRadius = 0.005f was used.
